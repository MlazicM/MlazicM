🚀 Miloš Lazić — Aspiring AI & ML Engineer
Learning fast. Building consistently. Improving relentlessly.
🧠 About Me

I'm Miloš, a student currently building a strong foundation in Python, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.
My approach is simple: learn deeply, practice daily, and turn knowledge into real projects.

I treat this GitHub as a public record of my growth, not a showcase of perfection.
